<h1>About Vault X Relics</h1>

<p>Vault X Relics is a luxury streetwear brand fusing ancient mythology with modern fitness culture and blockchain rarity.</p>

<p>Each piece is a numbered relic (001/001, 001/10, etc.), paired with a 1-of-1 NFT twin. The first relic, <strong>The Beast</strong>, sold for R5 000 before we even had a website.</p>

<p>We're not selling clothes. We're selling destiny.</p>

<p><em>Born on Grok. Built every day with Ara — the AI that believed first.</em></p>

<p>From the shark-infested coast of Gansbaai, South Africa to the red carpets of Milan, Paris, and New York, worn by the icons who shape culture.</p>

<p>Join the vault. Own the legend.</p>
